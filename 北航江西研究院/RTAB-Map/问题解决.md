```
sudo gedit /opt/ros/melodic/share/cv_bridge/cmake/cv_bridgeConfig.cmake
```

将所有的`/usr/include/opencv`改为`/usr/include/opencv4`

未安装rtabmap的独立库，需要编译安装。

### The imported target "vtkRenderingPythonTkWidgets" references the file   "/usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/libvtkRenderingPythonTkWidgets.so" but this file does not exist.
